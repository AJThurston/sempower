MPLUS Monte Carlo Simulation Power Analysis

## inspiration
[This example from Muthen & Muthen](http://statmodel.com/power.shtml) is much better and probably where I got started for my thesis power analysis.

## how to use
From what I remember, I found meta-analytic correlations between variables in my model (e.g., personality and experience).  For anything I couldn't find (e.g., factor loading for certain items) I used very conservative estimates (~.3 or .4) to upwardly bias sample size.

## my final model results from thesis
