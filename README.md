## how this works
I don't know. Magic, probably.

## how to use
From what I remember, I found meta-analytic correlations between variables in my model (e.g., personality and experience).  For anything I couldn't find (e.g., factor loading for certain items) I used very conservative estimates (~.3 or .4) to upwardly bias sample size.
